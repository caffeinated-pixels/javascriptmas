# JavaScriptmas Day 16 - Christmas Movie Selector

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 16 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write a function to select a suitable movie based on the age group and genre provided.
- Display it in the suggested-movie paragraph when the button is clicked.

I actually did it so the user doesn't need to click a button. If both age suitability and genre are selected, it will automatically choose a movie. This movie is randomly chosen from those that match the age and genre criteria. The displayed movie name links to its IMDB page.

Clicking the button chooses a random movie, which ignores the age and genre selections.

And, obviously, I updated the movie list to suit my own tastes üòÅ
