# JavaScriptmas Day 9 - Turn On Decorations

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 9 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write a function to add decorations (e.g. ☃️, 🎄, etc) next to the house when the switch is toggled.

I also added a message that appears. Super exciting!
