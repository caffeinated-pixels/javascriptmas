# JavaScriptmas Day 13 - Christmas Dinner Calculator

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 13 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write the JS to decide the perfect Christmas dinner and render it in the result element. Don't forget to check whether the meal should be vegetarian!

The dinner suggestions:

- Vegetarian: nut roast
- 4 people or less: turkey
- 5+ people: goose

I've added my own suggestion of going to a restuarant for 10 or more people ðŸ˜€
