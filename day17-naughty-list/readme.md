# JavaScriptmas Day 17 - Naughty List, Nice List

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 17 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write the JavaScript to sort the people in sorteesArr into the naughty and nice lists, according to whether they have been good or not. Then display the names in the relevant place in the DOM.

I also added the ability to add new people to either list and to move people from one list to the other. Everyone should be given the chance to redeem themselves üòÅ
