# JavaScriptmas Day 20 - Snowman customiser

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 20 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write a function to update the snowman colors according to the colors selected from the pickers.

I added an extra input to change pupil color.
