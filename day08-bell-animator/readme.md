# JavaScriptmas Day 8 - Bell Animator

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 8 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Animate the bell so that it looks like it is ringing when the music is playing, and stops when the music is paused or stopped.

I also imported the [animate.css library](https://animate.style/) via a CDN and added the bounce animation to the Christmas tree.
