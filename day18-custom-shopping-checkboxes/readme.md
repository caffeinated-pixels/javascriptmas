# JavaScriptmas Day 18 - Custom Shopping Checkboxes

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 18 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write the CSS to create custom checkboxes for our shopping list.

My solution is based on a [Stephanie Eckles Modern CSS Solutions article](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-checkbox-style/), but I've used a Christmas tree emoji as the checkmark.

While coding this, I found out that if you apply `font-weight: bold` to some emojis they will appear black and white in Chrome!
