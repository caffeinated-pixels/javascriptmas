# JavaScriptmas Day 12 - Christmas Guest List

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 12 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write the JS to render the Christmas day guest list in the guest-list element.
- Add the functionality to add new guests.

I also added a delete button to each guest to allow the user to remove any undesirables from the guest list.
