# JavaScriptmas Day 21 - Reindeer Speedometer

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 21 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Retrieve distance from previous destination from array of objects.
- Calculate speed and round speed to an integer (whole number).
- Display speed.

I noticed that the distances in the array are in nautical miles, so any speed calculation would be in knots and not mph! I've also assumed that the time refers to minutes, otherwise Santa would have a very long night ahead of him!!! ðŸŽ…

I've also displayed the previous previous location and distance above the inputs. And the calculation update when the user changes either input.
