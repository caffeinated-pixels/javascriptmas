# JavaScriptmas Day 15 - Festive Translator

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 15 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write a function to display the correct greeting when a language is selected.

I also added a text animation based on [rubberBand from animate.css](https://animate.style/) and a few extra languages, including Canadian and Australian 😁
