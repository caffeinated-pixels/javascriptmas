# JavaScriptmas Day 7 - Play a Christmas Song

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 7 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Add the functionality to play, pause and stop the jingling bells (bells.mp3).

I also added a volume slider. And, just for fun, I reused the music I added to the Day 6 challenge, which is the banging tune from the Fire & Ice Christmas Special (from the 1992 Amiga video game).
