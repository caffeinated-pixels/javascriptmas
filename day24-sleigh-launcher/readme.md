# JavaScriptmas Day 24 - Sleigh Launcher

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 24 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write a function to launch the sleigh!
- Write the CSS required to launch Santa and his sleigh.

I did this as a three part animation that starts a launch countdown before Santa zips away for good.

And this was the final JavaScriptmas challenge for 2021. So Merry Christmas and Happy Coding!
