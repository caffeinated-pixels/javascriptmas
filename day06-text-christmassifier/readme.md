# JavaScriptmas Day 6 - Text Christmassifier

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 6 challenge.

The task was to:

- Add `.christmassified` class to `#greeting` element
- Check whether christmassifierBtn has `.christmassified` on it. If so, change text to "De-christmassify", if not, change text to "Christmassify"

I also added some Amigatastic Christmas music (From the Fire & Ice Christmas Special, 1992) and a fun backdrop.
