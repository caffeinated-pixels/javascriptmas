# JavaScriptmas Day 10 - Festivity Loader

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 10 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write a function to wire up the festivity loader to reflect how many days are remaining until Christmas!

For fun, I made a candy-striped progress bar inspired by a [CSS Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/css3-progress-bars/). And the animation was based on a [W3 Schools article](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_progressbar.asp).
