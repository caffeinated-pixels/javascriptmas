# JavaScriptmas Day 22 - Christmas Stress Buster

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 22 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write a function to start the countdown timer on the button click and display it in the DOM. Stop the timer when it reaches 0.

I've also included functionality to pause and resume the timer and to restart it when it finishes. And it should play some nice relaxing piano music courtesy of Erik Satie.
