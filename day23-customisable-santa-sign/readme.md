# JavaScriptmas Day 23 - Customisable Santa Sign

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 23 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write a function to update the Santa Stop Here sign with the user's own text.

The message should update in realtime and I've added some emoji selectors.
