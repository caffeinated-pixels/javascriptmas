# JavaScriptmas Day 11 - Christmas carousel

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 11 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Wire up the buttons to switch through the images in the imgs array.
- Make sure that the gallery works no matter how many images are added.
- Decide/implement what to do when you reach either end of the array - do nothing and disable buttons, loop back round to the other end, or something else?
- Remember to also update the alt tags.
